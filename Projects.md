I'm about to teardown and build desktops and laptops easily. 
I've worked on setting up a router and learned port forwarding with the router. 
I learned to set up a DNS(Domain name service) and DHCP(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) servers
I've got basic hacking experince from completing OverTheWire Bandit levels 1-15
